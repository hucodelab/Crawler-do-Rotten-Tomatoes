In addition to Toma, the film will show lives of well-known artists of that time: Zoran Radmilovic, Mika Antic, Tozovac and others.

The second line is about Toma's life: from childhood in Pechenjevci to a friendship with the singer Silvana Armenulic, that will have crucial effect to his career and private life, to the time when he reached undreamed of popularity, but also touched the bottom of life.
